Content Strategy Recommendations for Streaming Platforms
1. Evergreen Content Focus
Movies and TV Shows remain the most liked and consistently engaging content types across platforms.

Dramas, international titles, comedies, and especially crime TV shows have enduring appeal.

Ensure these categories are updated monthly to maintain freshness and viewer retention.

2. Genre Trends by Format
Popular actors are increasingly associated with action-adventure films — this aligns with current audience trends.

These genres should be prioritized in seasonal or featured content lists, especially in movie libraries.

3. Optimal Content Duration
The preferred movie length falls in the 50–150 minute range.

This may also reflect director preferences, making it a strategic target window for acquisitions and in-house productions.

4. Director-Based Content Demand
Viewers show strong preference for works by versatile and well-known directors.

Include high-performing director-based collections in the library and update them bi-monthly to sustain interest.

5. Actor–Director Pairings
Recent actor-director collaborations have become major audience draws — in some cases, outperforming even top-decade actors.

Prioritize content featuring trending actor-director combos for homepage banners and recommendation engines.

6. Family & Children’s Content Gap
The current library underrepresents child and family-friendly programming.

Recommend a dedicated acquisition push in this genre to broaden demographic reach and cater to underserved segments.

7. Audience Content Rating Preferences
Globally, the audience prefers TV-MA and R-rated content.

However, in India, viewers lean more towards TV-14 rated shows — platform recommendations and libraries should reflect this regional variation.

8. Regional Library Trends in India
The total library size in India has decreased by nearly 50% between 2018 and 2021.

To regain market presence, initiate region-specific content expansion and invest in local production partnerships.

9. Most Popular TV Genres
Audiences strongly favor:

Classic & cult TV

TV comedies

Crime and drama series

TV science shows

These should form the core categories of ongoing licensing and recommendation strategies.

10. Emerging Regional Preferences
A surge in popularity for Korean and Japanese content, including anime and K-dramas, indicates a shift in regional audience tastes.

Expand partnerships with East Asian studios and feature this content in regional discovery zones.

11. Strategic Content Release Months
July and December are the optimal months for releasing blockbuster titles and exclusive content.

Aligns with summer breaks and Christmas holidays, when user engagement is highest.
